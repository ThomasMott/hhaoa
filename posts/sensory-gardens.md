## What is a sensory garden?

These are areas that are designed to have a variety of elements that usually stimulate a range of senses, but could be designed to target just one or two, such as smell and taste. This could be provided for animals by planting a variety of herbs and plants they could interact with. For more information on suitable plants see below, or why not arrange a Herbal Choices session to identify which plants are of particular interest. If using containers, care should be taken in choosing those that do not leach chemicals; this also includes the use of worn tyres which also have the potential to do this.

To stimulate other senses, such as touch, other elements could be added including a variety of materials to walk on such as pebbles, mulch, twigs, sand, wooded and gravelled areas. A water feature such as a pond or stream could also be beneficial, and sound could be introducted by adding fountains or waterfalls, or grasses that would create sound when they move in the wind; however adding objects that create loud or unpredictable noises are best avoided. Some animals may also enjoy things such as wind chimes, but you will be best gauged if this is suitable for their character. Lawned areas, or chamomile lawn, that are maintained pesticide-free, however small, are encouraged rather than "plastic" or artificial grass which can heat up quite dramatically on sunny days and is not biodegradable. Emission of toxins is also widely discussed on social media, however significant changes have been made since the first artificial turf was introduced in the 1960s, with lead and crumb rubber free options now available. However cheap imports would appear to be best avoided. Moss lawns are also growing in popularity as an option, as are clover lawns which are more resistant to urine stains.

The purpose of this type of garden is to not only provide sensory interest, but also a place that is relaxing for your animal; and whatever space is available, sensory enrichment elements can be scaled up or down to fit within this area. For more information about options to add see our Enrichment page.

Companion animals can also benefit from having access to plants for their health and well-being, as well as for enrichment. These may be eaten, rolled in/rubbed against or just inhaled. In fact a study analysing wolf (the closest relative of the dog) scat during the summer months revealed their diet contained 8% grasses and berries, with other studies showing around 20% plant matter. It is sometimes thought grasses are consumed to prevent parasites, but David Mech (an American wolf expert) feels it may be consumed for the vitamin content. This is also backed up by RSPCA vet Dr Michael Lazaris who advises "Dogs eat grass to try and get vitamins missing from their food". A short study by Dogs First seems to support this, with only 1 in 10 of the dogs that regularly selected grass being diagnosed with worms.

### Some beneficial plants for dogs:

-   Barley grass
-   Cat mint
-   Chamomile (German)
-   Cleavers
-   Echinacea
-   Fennel
-   Lavender
-   Lemon balm
-   Lemongrass
-   Marshmallow
-   Parsley
-   Pot Marigold
-   Roses
-   Wheatgrass
-   Yarrow

Cats may too eat plant matter, but as this is indigestible for them it is unlikely to be for nutritional benefit. In a study of wild cat scat they found 25% contained plant matter, consisting mainly of grasses and twigs (Ref: Feeding Ecology of a Feral Cat Population on a Small Mediterranean Island).

### Some beneficial plants for cats:

-   Barley grass
-   Catnip
-   Coriander
-   Lavender
-   Lemon balm
-   Peppermint
-   Roses
-   Valerian
-   Wheatgrass

Herbal supplements are sometimes added to an animal's feed however given the choice they may not choose all the constituents of these, but they could be broken down at a Herbal Choices session and offered individually; allowing your animal to choose. However, supplements prescribed by your vet should be continued and reviewed by them.
