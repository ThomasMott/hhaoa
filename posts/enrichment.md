## What is Enrichment

**“The act or process of adding or improving the quality or power of something by adding something else”**

### So how can we translate this to animals

We can add species appropriate items to their environment to stimulate senses and behaviour, along with offering and giving your animal the ability to choose. The European Commission has a document that requires “provision of enrichment materials to pigs” and states should provide “a sufficient quantity of suitable materials necessary to enable pigs to fulfil their innate needs to look for food (edible materials), bite (chewable materials), root (investigable materials) and manipulate (manipulable materials)”. This may be due to research finding that enrichment reduced the rate of aggression amongst pigs.

If we think about our daily routine with our animals we have a huge impact on their decisions, which is needed to keep them safe and often to be able to fit into our daily lives. But what makes your animal “tick”; what do they enjoy? Enrichment should bring enjoyment to your animal, positive experiences, and bring the wider world into their environment.

### Could this benefit your animal?

By introducing new experiences to your animal and giving them options to make decisions you not only build a better understanding of them, but it also enhances your bond. Problem solving is also well documented across a range of species and birds, in particular crows are remarkable problem solvers. Problem solving and enrichment is often cited as resulting in calmer, more confident animals, particularly in new situations, and an increase in optimism. Curiosity has also been shown as a key driver for learning. Link to OpenLearn information about problem-solving in animals.

## Providing enrichment for equines

Different terrain for horses and donkeys, such as sloping or hilly areas, and the introduction of obstacles such as felled logs and uneven surfaces could make use of different muscle groups.

Access to woodland and rough grazing, a sand-filled area or pond could also provide enrichment within the field or track setting, whilst also encouraging movement. Scratching posts can be made from broom brushes and are well received by horses, especially if access to suitable substitutes like trees is limited.

Horses and donkeys will naturally browse on (hedgerow) plants such as cow parsley, nettles, etc, as well as overhanging tree branches and shrubs, and access to these could be beneficial to your horse, as well as natural enrichment. If available this would typically make up around 10% of their diet, but can be as high as 50% in some cases. The greater diversity of plants available will allow your horse access to, and the ability to select from, the many constituents these plants offer, and the amount your horse requires to maintain their health and well-being.

## Enrichment for companion animals

Enrichment can be made accessible within the confines of a garden or yard, or room in a house, and can take many forms. Knowing your animal is the key to providing this for them; basically what makes them happy. For your dog this could be as simple as placing their favourite toy in a pile of autumn leaves and giving them guidance to seek it out - seeking games, along with a variety of problem solving games, supports mental development and boosts confidence. As dogs see the colours yellow and blue predominantly, these could also be incorporated.

Dogs are also driven by scent, creating a picture of their environment by using this tool, and can be added for enrichment. While out on a walk with your dog, be present with them - what do you hear and smell; observe them and see what interests them, do they sniff certain objects, for example a feather. Overgrown grassy areas hide a multitude of scents, particularly small animals that may frequent the area. When you can, let your dog choose which path to take, even for part of your walk.

In your garden - if your dog loves digging, are you able to turn over an area for them to do this? Do they love digging in the sand when you are out and about? Could you add a sandpit to their environment, that can be covered when not in use? Does your dog love swimming? On a recent holiday we took a paddle-board and our dog loved swimming out to us and then riding on it while we were in the sea. Could you introduce water, even a paddling pool, to their area? Dogs and cats would benefit from the introduction of structures at varying heights, creating an observational point for them, as well as working different muscle groups when accessing them. In addition a "den" area could provide a "chill out zone" or area of shade in hotter weather, or just somewhere to play hide and seek. Many cats and dogs enjoy fresh plants and also dried herbs and may roll in these, or just inhale the aroma. Cats could make use of a log as a scratching post, or a bigger wood structure to allow them to climb naturally. Even a couple of old wooden stepladders, with secured planks across from one to the other, would create an interesting structure for cats. A range of plants could also be introduced - for more information see our Sensory Garden page.

Cats love high places, and there are many wonderful structures that can be bought to allow them to move around your room off the ground when in the house or in a catio.

## Scents & Sniffing

The Dog Field Study found sniffing has a direct impact on a dog's pulse rate. By giving your dog time to sniff while out on a walk it can reduce their pulse rate, with more intense sniffing reducing it further. By adding length to their lead this increases the amount of time your dog will spend sniffing, with a dog off lead spending the most. Statistics from the study state dogs on a long lead (5 metres) spend 280% more time sniffing when compared to a short lead (1.5 metres); with 330% more time sniffing when off lead. When your dog becomes calm and relaxed this impacts their heart rate by reducing it, and consequently their pulse rate. Thus slowing down and stopping during your walk would allow your dog to sniff, and by varying walks and taking your dog to new locations this will also provide environmental enrichment for them.

Scent makes up a large part of a dog’s sensory world; building confidence and coping skills as more understanding is gained. Time spent analysing odours lowers the pulse, as raised above, and could also promote cognitive function.

Your dog builds up a picture of its environment by sniffing and Alexandra Horowitz writes "As we see the world, the dog smells it ..... The world of scent is at least as rich as the world of sight".

To maintain and support the lining of your dog's nose Vitamin A will certainly be beneficial and can be found in a number of foods, including herbs.

As sniffing is mentally stimulating for your dog, allowing your dog a period of “down-time” after a lot of sniffing interaction would be very beneficial.

## Licking & Chewing

Licking and chewing are soothing in their actions for dogs.

Licking has been cited as promoting relaxation for dogs and cats, due particularly to the release of endorphins (feel-good chemicals) and often LickiMats are useful in a variety of situations. Consequently, stressful situations may trigger excessive licking and grooming, though not exclusively, and other causes should be ruled out by your vet.

Chewing also has a calming effect for dogs, releasing Serotonin and Dopamine, giving dogs a tool to “self-medicate” when anxious or stressed, and hard chews such as antler, or yak chews may be beneficial, though you should always consider how your dog would interact and and whether these would be appropriate for them.

Chewing may also be useful for cats too, particularly supporting good dental health, and silver vine sticks may be beneficial.

Stress and tension can be carried through the jaws and shoulders of dogs, and should you encounter this it may be beneficial to offer a soft chew initially to relax the muscles, after which a harder chew could be offered.
