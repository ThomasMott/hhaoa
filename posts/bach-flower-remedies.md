## Supporting your animal with Bach® Flower Remedies

Dr Edward Bach took what was probably seen as an unorthodox approach in his field of medicine, in that he felt the emotional state had an impact on health, and that emotions such as fear and unhappiness could lead to ill-health. Thus by addressing emotional imbalance it would halt progression to physical health problems. The 38 remedies were borne out of this belief and Dr Bach devoted his life to creating these, and also established The Bach® Centre in Oxfordshire. This statement from Nelsons® (who are partnered with the Bach® Centre, and prepare their essences) really resonates -
“Bach® Original Flower Remedies was founded on the simple idea that ingredients born from nature can be incredibly powerful in supporting our emotional wellbeing ….”

Nelsons is the only company authorised by The Bach® Centre to produce the Bach® flower essences - created by using wild flowers, trees and bushes, some of which are still hand-picked from gardens at The Bach® Centre. Flower essences are prepared by using both the sun method (using only sunlight and fresh spring water) and boiling method (simmering in fresh spring water using an enamel pan). The resulting energised water, and filtered water, are then traditionally preserved with brandy, thus creating the mother tincture - 2 drops of this are then used to prepare stock bottles. Flower essences work on a vibrational level, containing the vibrational energy of flowers and plants, and as such do not interfere with medication.

These remedies are able to support current emotional disturbances in animals, birds and reptiles as they are responsive to the Bach® flower essences, with many anecdotal and success stories to support this. Rescue Remedy® , which combines five Bach® Original Flower Essences, is well known among animal carers, and is often available in pet first aid kits.

## What does the session involve?

Prior to the session we request completion of a Consultation form, and ask that you contact your vet to ensure they are willing for the session to go ahead - if your vet requires further information we are happy to communicate directly with them.

At the Bach® Flower Remedies session we meet both you and your animal, and after discussion and observations we combine a small number of the essences taking into account their detailed history, both past and present. We also offer this service as a remote session via Zoom.

The session lasts around 30 - 45 minutes, with preparation of a remedy bottle, and instructions for use.

**Please note we use only flower essences with no alcohol content.**
