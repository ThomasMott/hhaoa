## What is Reiki?

Reiki is a form of energy healing that works holistically, and is a non-invasive therapy that provides natural healing vibrations. This energy is transferred or transmitted to the animal through the hands of a practitioner, by either hands-on, by distance or by absent (where the animal is not present). This then flows to the area it is needed most; assisting the animal in its natural healing process by releasing emotional blocks and balancing energies. This in turn could promote relaxation which could have a positive impact on some behavioural issues.

### Reiki could also help:

-   Aid recovery from an illness, surgery or injury
-   Relieve stress, calm anxious and nervous animals
-   Raise energy levels
-   Relieve aches and pains

Reiki should always be given with love, and a calmness of mind, to open up the communication channels. It can be both an emotional and spiritual experience.

When animals are open to receiving Reiki they are very sensitive to the healing energy. During the session itself they may enter a deeply relaxed and peaceful state.

## What does the session involve?

Prior to the session we request completion of a Consultation form, as well as requesting you advise your vet about the session.

At the session Reiki can be given by either hands-on (by placing hands on the animal), or by distance (where hands are placed at a short distance away from the animal).

An animal will indicate their preference as to how (hands-on or distance), and if they wish, to receive Reiki, and when they wish a session to conclude - thus all guided by the animal.

The session lasts on average around 30 - 45 minutes from start to finish and would be best arranged at a time when there will be no interruptions.
